# MDX Parser

Experiments with the Alpha WoW (0.5.3) MDX files. 

The MDXLib project is fully compliant with parsing version 1300 of the format and may be useful to some people. However the M2 conversion only works with WoW Model Viewer (not in-game) and of that, only rendering of basic geometry and animations has been implemeted.

Uses Koward's [M2Lib](https://github.com/Koward/M2Lib). For a specification on the file format see the [wowdev wiki](https://wowdev.wiki/MDX).
